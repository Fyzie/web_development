    For years, he has been working as Construction Worker. One day, he feels like he want to open a business instead
    to improve his life rather than sticking to the same journey until the end of his life.
</p>
<p>
    First, he open a bank account for his business. What kind of bussiness? He's thinking about selling 
    soft cookies. He did learn how to bake them with his grandma years ago. And he's pretty sure he remembered everything.
    At least he like them while having them as a new source of income too.
