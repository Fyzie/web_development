Today, i went to office with motorcycle. I rode along the SUKE highway. Before reaching the office, 
I stopped for petrol.

When i arrived to the office, there is no one yet. As usual! I first unpacked the ethernet switch which just arrived.
Then, I continued my yesterday work to collect all image data for the AVI training.
